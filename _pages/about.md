# About Me

I am currently a graduate student at [<img src="/images/logo-cornell.png" style="height:1em; vertical-align:middle;">](https://www.cornell.edu/), pursuing a M.Eng. in Financial Engineering, and I expect to graduate in December 2025.

I am now seeking a summer 2025 internship in **quantitative research**, **quantitative trading**, or **quantitative risk analysis**.

I hold a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Mathematical Economics from [<img src="/images/SUFE.png" style="height:1em; vertical-align:middle;">](https://www.sufe.edu.cn/) <span style="color: rgb(144, 39, 40);">Shanghai University of Finance and Economics</span>. My academic background is strongly rooted in data science, econometrics, and machine learning.

Recently, I served as a Quantitative Research Intern at LianHai Capital Asset Management, LLC, where I leveraged my expertise in statistical analysis and reinforcement learning to drive key projects. I also have experience as a Global Alpha Researcher at Trexquant Investment LP and as an Econometrics Research Assistant at my alma mater, where I contributed to a project commissioned by the Shanghai Bureau of Statistics.
